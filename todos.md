# opencode blocker - Future Improvements

## High Priority

- [ ] Spin up server from within the plugin itself (no separate `bun run` needed)
- [ ] Auto-install Chrome extension from server CLI
- [ ] Publish plugin to npm as `opencode-blocker-plugin`
- [ ] Add proper extension icons (PNG format)

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Add CLI with `--setup` flag to configure opencode.json automatically
- [ ] Support configurable port via environment or config
- [ ] Add visual indicator in terminal when blocker is active

## Low Priority

- [ ] Desktop notification when blocking state changes
- [ ] Statistics tracking (time saved, blocks prevented)
- [ ] Whitelist mode (block everything except configured sites)
